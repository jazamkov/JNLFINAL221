    The two people featured above are Nathan MacKinnon of the Colorado Avalanche in the National Hockey League, and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors in the National Basketball Association. Both players are considered to be superstars in their respective leagues, the best of the best. The pay gap between these players is significant. The pay gap between both leagues is substantial. But, why is that? Is it the TV revenue? Is it the ticket revenue? Could it be that the NBA is just a bigger market than the NHL? The answer to this question may seem obvious but let me offer a different perspective.

        <h2>The difference between the NHL and the NBA
        </h2>
      </div>

       <div class="story">
        <p>The NBA and the NHL are 2 extremely different sports. The players play on different surfaces, hockey is more physical and hard-nosed, basketball is more skillful and swift. But, a ginormous difference between the 2 major sports is the salary, and that is the biggest contrast that exists between the leagues. The salary cap in the NBA is just over $136 Million while the NHL's salary cap is around $83.5 Million. You may ask, why is the gap so large?  </p>


          <p>Roster size between the leagues are also different. In the NBA, more often than not you will see an 8-9 man rotation of who plays, but in the NHL there are 19 guys that play in every single game (not including injuries). There are players who never see the floor in the NBA making more than some of the NHL's best, and that is a problem. Both regular seasons are 82 games that stretch from October to April, and then there are playoffs.   </p>
  

   
          <p> The main argument for why the gap is so big is TV Viewership. Does the NBA receive more TV ratings than the NHL, the simple answer is yes. But, regular season NBA games are broadcasted on National Television in the United States more frequently than the NHL regular season. Television in the United States is completely different from Canada which is where you will find nationally televised Hockey games. So, the ratings from television are lopsided because of the unavailability of games in the United States. </p>

          <div class="First-image">

          </div>


          <p> Most of the players in the NHL hail from 3 countries, The United States, Russia, and Canada. Hockey is THE sport in Canada. If you visit the country, everywhere you look there are signs for the 7 teams that reside in Canada. Whether it is in Winnipeg for the Jets, Ottawa for the Senators, or the country's pride and joy, the Montreal Canadiens; the fan bases are all-in. Children who are born in Canada, are born to play hockey. The difference between Canada and the United States is that the United States markets the NBA, and Canada markets the NHL.  </p>

          <p>Recently the NHL's viewership has skyrocketed. It has nearly doubled since the signing of a lengthy deal with ESPN for broadcasting rights. ESPN now has the rights to broadcast every NHL game on their featured channel ESPN+. With the viewership ratings increasing as the season goes on, the question remains, will the NHL ever close the gap on the NBA in terms of player salaries. </p>

          <p>The NHL is on the rise as a league. The ESPN partnership has increased the amount of viewers tremendously and has created a new buzz around the league. Fox 56 News/Sports Reporter and Newhouse Graduate Tyler Melito believes that with the partnership, the NHL can surpass the NBA in TV ratings in a few years. "The NHL is in a better place than most people think," Melito said, "The best thing that Gary Bettman has done as the league's commissioner is partner with a national broadcast station. It will continue to grow the sport, and more and more fans will become attracted to it."  </p>


         <p>Let's take a look at some of the highest paid players for each sport. </p>

        </div>

        
          <p>Blindly looking at these 2 graphs, you may think they are the same. But, if you examine the values at a closer look, the numbers aren't close. The last player in the NBA graph is Gabe Vincent, a guard for the Los Angeles Lakers making a little over $10 million per year. Vincent is averaging 6.0 points and 3.0 assists per game, respectable, but nothing superstar worthy. The top paid player in the NHL is Nathan MacKinnon, who is making a little less than $13 million per year. A contender for the Hart Trophy (The NHL's MVP award) year in and year out, is just barely making more than the 149th most paid player in the NBA.</p>


          <p>Aside from TV revenue, both leagues make their money off fans. Whether it is selling memorabilia, selling tickets, or selling jerseys; teams make money off of their fans. Fandom is not a problem for the NHL, hockey fans are arguably the best fans in sports. Where it differs from the NBA is stadiums. Typically both leagues have sell out crowds on a game-to-game basis. But, NBA stadiums seat more than hockey stadiums usually do. But, with the sales of jerseys, hats, and other forms of apparel, the NHL catches up to the NBA. </p>

        

        <p> Now, does the NBA have a more national audience than the NHL does? Absolutely. The NBA has done a great job of marketing their big events such as the NBA Finals or the In Season Tournament. The postseason for both sports and their ratings is barely even comparable. The NBA blows the NHL out of the water in terms of TV ratings, maybe not live attendance (But we will get into that later). This is a side by side comparison of the TV ratings of the NBA Finals VS. The Stanley Cup Finals. The numbers, frankly, aren't close.</p>

        <p>As someone who watches the NHL more frequently than the NBA, these last 2 seasons have been fantastic. I have been able to watch more games than I ever have, and my love for the sport has only grown. While the NBA has been at a standstill of ratings for the past few years, the NHL has increased it's number of fans and the amount of people that watch the game; which is amazing for a once passed on sport.</p>
